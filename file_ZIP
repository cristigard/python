#CREATING ZIP FILE FROM MULTIPLE FILE
In this method, ZipFile() creates a ZIP file in which the files which are to be compressed are added. 


import zipfile

#create an zip object(without compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED the file will not be compressed)
with zipfile.ZipFile(f'path/to/test.zip', 'w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip_object:
   # Adding files that need to be zipped(filename = file to be added in archive, arcname = how file will be named in archive folder)
   #if want arcname='file_name.xml' to be inside a subfolder -> arcname='subfolder/file_name.xml'
   zip_object.write(filename='path/to/file/to/be/compressed', arcname='name_of_file_after_compression')
