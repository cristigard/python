#Creating ZIP file from multiple files
In this method, ZipFile() creates a ZIP file in which the files which are to be compressed are added. 


import zipfile


rnd_no = random.getrandbits(32)
# current_dir = os.getcwd()
current_dir = "C:/Users/USER IT-04/Desktop/"
dir_name = f'{datetime.date.today()}_{rnd_no}'.replace('-','_')
dir_path = os.path.join(current_dir,dir_name).replace('\\','/')


#create an zip object(without compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED the file will not be compressed)
with zipfile.ZipFile(f'{dir_path}.zip', 'w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip_object:
   # Adding files that need to be zipped(filename = file to be added in archive, arcname = how file will be named in archive folder)
   #if want arcname='file_name.xml' to be inside a subfolder -> arcname='subfolder/file_name.xml'
   zip_object.write(filename='C:/Users/USER IT-04/Desktop/file_xml.xml', arcname='file_name.xml')
